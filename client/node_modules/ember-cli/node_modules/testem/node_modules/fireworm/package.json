Because of this, it can detect newly created files, new files in newly created directories, re-created files, and even new files within re-created directories too - as long as the file matches the paths you are watching.\n\nAs of version 0.5.2, fireworm uses `fs.watch` to watch directories only.\n\n## API\n\n### Constructor\n\n`fireworm(dir, [options])` - returns a file watcher object for files within `dir`.\n\nOptions:\n\n* `ignoreInitial:boolean` (default `false`) - do not fire `add` events when encountering files or directory for the initial time it is crawled.\n* `skipDirEntryPatterns:array` (default `['node_modules', '.*']`) - when crawling directories, skip the directory entries which match these glob patterns.\n\n### File Watcher Object\n\n### Methods\n\n* `add(filepath:string|array)` - add these file patterns (glob) to the watch list. The parameter(s) can be a variable number of strings or arrays of strings.\n* `ignore(filepath:string|array)` - add these file patterns (glob) to the ignore list. The parameter(s) can be a variable number of strings or arrays of strings.\n* `clear()` - clear all previously added match patterns or ignore patterns.\n\n### Events\n\nFile watcher objects are [EventEmitters](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter), and can emit these events:\n\n* `add` - fired when a matching file has been added to the FS. Parameter: `path` - the path to the file\n* `change` - fired when a matching file has been modified. Parameter: `path` - the path to the file\n* `remove` - fired when a matching file has been removed from the FS. Parameter: `path` - the path to the file\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Toby Ho &lt;airportyh@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
